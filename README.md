# gPAC: GPU-Accelerated Phase-Amplitude Coupling

gPAC is a Python library for GPU-accelerated Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) analysis in neural
signals. The project leverages PyTorch to efficiently process large neural datasets by parallelizing
computation on GPUs.

The main components include:

1. Core PAC calculation with differentiable bandpass filters that allow gradient flow
2. Flexible implementation supporting various parameters (frequency bands, chunk processing)
3. Modulation Index calculation for quantifying coupling strength
4. FP16 support for improved performance through mixed precision

Recent bug fixes focused on:
1. Fixing a shape mismatch issue in the PAC classifier when handling channel dimensions
2. Improving tensor handling to eliminate PyTorch warnings
3. Enhancing tensor contiguity for operations like torch.bucketize()

The code allows both trainable and fixed bandpass filters, enabling either standard PAC analysis or
integration with deep learning pipelines where frequency bands can be learned from data.





This repository contains source code and manuscript of our `gPAC` project.

`gPAC` is designed for efficient calculation of Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) using PyTorch, enabling significant speedups through parallel execution on GPU especially for large datasets.

## Rationale for GPU Acceleration

The Modulation Index (MI) method for PAC calculation, implemented in `gPAC`, involves several computationally intensive steps:

1.  **Bandpass Filtering:** Extracting signals within specific low-frequency (phase) and high-frequency (amplitude) bands.
2.  **Hilbert Transform:** Calculating the analytic signal to obtain instantaneous phase and amplitude.
3.  **Modulation Index Calculation:** Quantifying the relationship between phase and amplitude, often involving binning and entropy measures (like Kullback-Leibler divergence).
4.  **Permutation Testing (Optional):** Repeating the calculation on surrogate data (e.g., shuffled time series) for statistical validation (Z-scoring).

Howerver, each of these steps possesses characteristics suitable for parallelization, especially on GPUs:

-   Filtering for different frequency bands can be performed independently.
-   The Hilbert transform (via FFT) can be applied independently to multiple channels or segments.
-   The MI calculation, involving binning and aggregation, can often be vectorized or parallelized across frequency band pairs.
-   Surrogate computations are inherently parallel, as each permutation is independent.

`gPAC` leverages PyTorch's CUDA capabilities to execute these steps in parallel on the GPU, significantly reducing computation time compared to sequential CPU processing.

## Differentiable Filters and Trainable Band Ranges

`gPAC` optionally supports differentiable bandpass filters, enabling end-to-end training when incorporated into larger deep learning models. This differentiability is achieved by leveraging sinc-based convolutional filters, as demonstrated by M. Ravanelli and Y. Bengio [1].

While phase calculation in the Hilbert transform involve analitically non-differentiable points (e.g., phase wraps at +/- pi), they are still "computationally differentiable" by defining a subgradient (or practically setting the gradient to zero or one) at these points. This is in a similar manner to how the ReLU activation function at x=0 is managed in deep learning frameworks.

This allows a model to potentially learn optimal frequency bands for PAC calculation relevant to a specific task directly from data, which might offer insights for underlying biological mechanisms.

## Basic Usage

```python
import torch
import gpac
import numpy as np

# --- Parameters ---
fs = 1024  # Sampling frequency
seq_len = fs * 5  # 5 seconds of data
batch_size = 4
n_chs = 16
n_segments = 1 # Example: treating each channel trace as one segment

# --- Generate Example Signal ---
# Replace with your actual data loading
# Shape: (batch_size, n_channels, n_segments, sequence_length)
signal_np = np.random.randn(batch_size, n_chs, n_segments, seq_len).astype(np.float32)
signal_gpu = torch.from_numpy(signal_np).cuda() # Move to GPU

# --- Calculate PAC ---
try:
    pac_values, freqs_pha, freqs_amp = gpac.calculate_pac(
        signal=signal_gpu,
        fs=fs,
        pha_n_bands=50,       # Number of phase frequency bands
        amp_n_bands=30,       # Number of amplitude frequency bands
        pha_start_hz=2.0,     # Min frequency for phase
        pha_end_hz=20.0,      # Max frequency for phase
        amp_start_hz=60.0,    # Min frequency for amplitude
        amp_end_hz=160.0,     # Max frequency for amplitude
        device='cuda',        # Specify computation device
        fp16=True,            # Use mixed-precision (optional)
        n_perm=200,           # Calculate Z-score with 200 permutations (optional)
        # trainable=False,    # Use static filters (default)
        # chunk_size=16       # Process in chunks (optional, if memory is limited)
    )

    print("PAC calculation successful.")
    # Output shape depends on n_perm and amp_prob flags
    print(f"Output PAC Tensor Shape: {pac_values.shape}")
    print(f"Phase Frequencies (Num): {len(freqs_pha)}")
    print(f"Amplitude Frequencies (Num): {len(freqs_amp)}")

    # pac_values tensor will be on the specified device ('cuda' in this case)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred during PAC calculation: {e}")
```
